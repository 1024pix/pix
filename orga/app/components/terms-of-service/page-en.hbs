      <li>Information and data,</li>
      <li>Communication and collaboration,</li>
      <li>Content creation,</li>
      <li>Protection and security,</li>
      <li>Environment and digital technology.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The Pix Orga platform is based on the Pix platform and enables specifier users to launch testing campaigns for any
      type of audience receiving support on the topic of digital skills (people in initial on ongoing training, within
      the framework of digital mediation initiatives and/or employees within public or private organisations, for
      example) and collect and analyse the results from the Pix platform.

      <b>Step 1.</b>
       The user fills in a web form on the Pix platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      The form shows the required data that must be filled in to create a user account (first name, surname, email
      address and password) with an asterisk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The user must enter a valid email address that will enable a confirmation email to be sent when their user account
      is created. Furthermore, they must choose a password that meets the following requirements:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>8 characters minimum with at least one letter and one digit.
      </li>
    </ul>

      <b>Step 2.</b>
      The user logs into their user account with their login credentials, it being recalled that they are personal and
      confidential.

    <p>
      The user is solely responsible for ensuring the password remains confidential, and as a result, the consequences
      of involuntary disclosure to anyone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any use of the user account with the password allocated to the user is presumed to originate exclusively from the
      user.

    <p>
      They can reset the password via the user account by clicking the ‘Forgot your password?’ tab then by entering
      their email address. An email will be sent to the user, enabling them to define a new password that must also
      comply with the aforementioned requirements.

    </ul>
    <p>
      By common consent, the parties agree that a user invited by a Pix Orga user to an assessment campaign will contact
